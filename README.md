# MOA/SCBS Site

This is a repo for a multipage site, it uses Gulp, SCSS and Nunjucks.

The root of the site is in the `docs` folder. To develop using Gulp etc - after `npm install` run `gulp watch`.

If you don't have the Gulpjs cli installed you'll need to install that first: `npm install gulp-cli -g`.
